# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Add Screenshot

To complete the README display, you need to add the screenshot:

1. Take a screenshot of the running application showing:
   - The 3D globe with Ireland visible
   - The green beam heading line
   - The control panel on the left
   - The compass in the top-right
   - Status showing "Connected"

2. Save the screenshot as: `docs/images/screenshot.png`

3. Commit and push:
```bash
git add docs/images/screenshot.png
git commit -m "docs: add application screenshot"
git push origin main
```

The README is already configured to display this image prominently at the top.
